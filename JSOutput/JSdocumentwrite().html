      <!-- using document.write() erases all the contents of a page and opens a new document with only the contents of the 
       documents.write part in it
       
       This is because of a few reasons
       
         1. every html file is loaded as document.
         2. each line of code is loaded in steps
         3. after completely loading any html documemt the doument.close() is called
         4. once a document.write() is called after a document.close() was called a new document.open() is called
         5. This means everything on the existing document is erased and only the new document.open() contents are displayed-->

         <h2>
            Web page!
         </h2>

         <p>
            What can document.write() do?
         </p>

         <script>
            document.write(5+6);
         </script>

         <p>calling a document.write() before the html document closes is okay. In the next section we will call the element in a button which
            is triggered after the document is closed.
         </p>

         <button type="button" onclick="document.write('This page was refereshed because document.open() was called again and hence you lost all the previous progress')">TRY!!</button>
   </body>
